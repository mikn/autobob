autobob
=======

A chat bot designed (almost) like a software project!


##Requirements
Python 3.4+ (ohmygod venv)

##Installing!

Even now it is rather simple, make sure you create a venv first

Then run `python setup.py develop`
Now you should have a fully functioning `autobob` command within your venv!
It doesn't do much right now, though. But it will come with time...
